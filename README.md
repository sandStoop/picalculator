# The first interactive GNU bc Pi calculation software

**Put your computation to Pi!**. This is GNU bc geek software used to calculate Pi with a few algorithms and with the decimal amount you want. It's extremely fitting to GNU bc's limitations and problems.

## The Bad

1. It is slower compared to ***y-cruncher***, ***C***, ***C++*** and I doubt that Python wouldn't beat GNU bc. Apart from those programs using more optimized algorithms, it's hard to implement such optimized algorithms in GNU bc and it's also faulty GNU bc. If you're serious about speeds, switch to these solutions or if you love pain, try doing it better in GNU bc
2. No optimized algorithms implemented, it would increase speed
3. GNU bc is simply not very good
